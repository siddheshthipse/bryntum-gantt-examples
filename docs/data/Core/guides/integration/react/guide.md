## Requirements

Bryntum Core requires React `16.0.0` or higher,
and for applications written in TypeScript, TypeScript `3.6.0` or higher.

## Bryntum NPM repository access

Please refer to this [guide for Bryntum NPM repository access](#Core/guides/npm-repository.md).

## Bryntum Core

Bryntum Core itself is framework agnostic, but ships with demos and wrappers to simplify using it with popular
frameworks such as React. The purpose of this guide is to give a basic introduction on how to use Bryntum Core
with React.

Bryntum Core is integrated to React applications using the provided wrappers.

### The React wrappers

The wrappers encapsulate Bryntum Core and other Bryntum widgets in React components that expose configuration
options, properties, features and events. The wrapped Bryntum components are then used the usual React way.

## View online demos

Bryntum Core demos can be viewed in our
[online example browser](https://bryntum.com/products/core/examples/?framework=react).

## Build and run local demos

Download distribution zip with demos according to this [guide](#Core/guides/download.md#distribution).

React demos are located in **examples/frameworks/react** folder inside distribution zip.

Each demo contains bundled `README.md` file in demo folder with build and run instructions.

You may run them either in development mode or built for production. They have been created using the latest version of
[React Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

In our Bryntum examples, we use `start` script for local development server:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The default `package.json` generated by Vite does not include `start` in scripts, so you may run existing
`dev` script instead:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts a local server accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). If you modify the example code
while running it locally, it is automatically rebuilt and updated in the browser allowing you to see the changes
immediately.

The production version of an example, or your application, is built by running:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

The built version is then located in `build` sub-folder which contains the compiled code that can be deployed to your
production server.

## TypeScript and Typings

Bryntum bundles ship with typings for the classes for usage in TypeScript applications. You can find `core*.d.ts`
files in the `build` folder inside the distribution zip package. The definitions also contain a special config type
which can be passed to the class constructor.

The config specific types are also accepted by multiple other properties and functions, for example
the [Store.data](#Core/data/Store#config-data) config of the `Store` which accepts type `Partial<ModelConfig>[]`.

Sample code for tree store creation with `ModelConfig` and `StoreConfig` classes:

```typescript
import { Store, StoreConfig, ModelConfig } from '@bryntum/core';

const storeConfig: Partial<StoreConfig> = {
    tree : true,
    data : [
        {
            id       : 1,
            children : [
                {
                    id : 2
                }
            ] as Partial<ModelConfig>[]
        }
    ] as Partial<ModelConfig>[]
};

new Store(storeConfig);
```

## Wrappers

### Installing the wrappers package

The wrappers are implemented in a separate package `@bryntum/core-react` that is installed according to the used
package manager. Please refer to this [guide for Bryntum NPM repository access](#Core/guides/npm-repository.md).

To use native API package classes with wrappers import them from `@bryntum/core`.

```javascript
import { Core } from '@bryntum/core';
```

### Wrappers Overview

Wrappers are React components which provide full access to Bryntum API widget class configs, properties, events and
features. Each Wrapper has it's own tag which can be used in React JSX code. This is the list of available wrappers for
Bryntum Core React package.

| &lt;BryntumYearPicker/&gt;             | [YearPicker](#Core/widget/YearPicker)                         |

### Using the wrapper in your application

The wrapper defines a React component named `BryntumCore`. You can use it the same way as you would use other React
components. For example:

Sample code for `App.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BryntumCore } from '@bryntum/core-react';
import { coreConfig } from './AppConfig'

export const App = () => {
    return (
        <BryntumCore
            {...coreConfig}
            // other props, event handlers, etc
        />
    );
}
```

Sample code for `AppConfig.js`:

```javascript
export const coreConfig = {
    tooltip : "My cool Bryntum Core component",
    // Bryntum Core config options
};
```

### Using the wrapper in TypeScript application

Bryntum React wrappers for Bryntum Core are bundled with TypeScript definitions which makes it possible to use them
in TypeScript React applications.

Each wrapper has properties definitions stored in a class with the wrapper's name and suffixed with `Props`.

This code shows how to use typed wrapper configuration for `BryntumCore`:

**AppConfig.ts:**

```typescript
import { BryntumCoreProps } from '@bryntum/core-react';

const coreConfig: BryntumCoreProps = {
    // Wrapper configuration
    ...
};
```

**App.tsx:**

```typescript
import React, { Fragment, FunctionComponent, useRef } from 'react';
import { BryntumCore } from '@bryntum/core-react';
import { Core } from '@bryntum/core';
import { coreConfig } from './AppConfig';

const App: FunctionComponent = () => {
    const coreRef      = useRef<BryntumCore>(null);
    const coreInstance = () => coreRef.current?.instance as Core;

    return (
        <Fragment>
            <BryntumCore
                ref = { coreRef }
    {...
        coreConfig
    }
    />
    < /Fragment>
)
    ;
};

export default App
```

### Embedding widgets inside wrapper

Wrappers are designed to allow using Bryntum widgets as React components, but they themselves cannot contain other
Bryntum wrappers inside their tag. To embed Bryntum widgets inside a wrapper you should instead use the available
configuration options for the wrapper's widget. Please note that not all widgets may contain inner widgets, please refer
to the API docs to check for valid configuration options.

This example shows how to use a `Toolbar` widget inside the wrapper for Bryntum Core:

Sample code for `AppConfig.js`:

```javascript
export const coreConfig = {
    // Toolbar (tbar) config
    tbar : {
        items : [
            {
                type : 'button',
                text : 'My button'
            }
        ]
    }
    // Bryntum Core config options
};
```

### Syncing bound data changes

The stores used by the wrapper enable [syncDataOnLoad](#Core/data/Store#config-syncDataOnLoad) by default (Stores not
used by the wrapper have it disabled by default). This allows two-way binding to work out of the box.
Without `syncDataOnLoad`, each change to state would apply the bound data as a completely new dataset.
With `syncDataOnLoad`, the new state is instead compared to the old, and the differences are applied.

## Rendering React components in column cells

Bryntum Core column already supports a [renderer](#Grid/column/Column#config-renderer) configuration option which is
a function that receives parameters used as inputs to compose the resulting html. Any kind of conditional complex logic
can be used to prepare visually rich cell contents.

If you have a React component that implements the desired cell visualization, it is possible to use it by using regular
JSX which references your React components from the cell renderer. The support is implemented in the `BryntumCore`
wrapper therefore the wrapper must be used for the JSX renderers to work.

### Using simple inline JSX

Using inline JSX is as simple as the following:

```javascript
renderer: ({ value }) => <CustomComponent>{value}</CustomComponent>
```

If you also need to access other data fields or pass them into the React component, you can do it this way:

```javascript
renderer: (renderData) => {
    return (
        <CustomComponent dataProperty={renderData}><b>{renderData.value}</b>/{renderData.record.city}
        </CustomComponent>
    );
}
```

<div class="note">

Mind please that the above functions return html-like markup without quotes. That makes the return value JSX and it is
understood and processed as such. If you enclose the markup in quotes it will not work

</div>

## Using React components in tooltips and widgets

_Important:_

1. The support for React Components is implemented in the Core wrapper therefore in applications that
   does not use the wrapper, but creates the Core instances directly, JSX in tooltips and widgets does not work.

2. React Components support works only in tooltips and widgets that are children of Core, not in standalone
   tooltips or widgets. In such cases, however, JSX can be used directly and does not need be "wrapped" in a Bryntum
   widget. Therefore, this is not a limitation, it is only to be considered in the application design.

### React components in tooltips

Tooltips are usually configured as features that use JSX returned from the feature renderer or template. For example:

```javascript
const coreConfig = {
    cellTooltipFeature  : {
        tooltipRenderer : ({ record }) => (
            <React.StrictMode>
                <DemoTooltip record={record}/>
            </React.StrictMode>
        )
    },
    eventTooltipFeature : {
        template : data => (
            <React.StrictMode>
                <DemoEventTip data={data}/>
            </React.StrictMode>
        )
    }
}

return <BryntumCore {...coreConfig} />
```

and:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const DemoTooltip = props => {
    const { record } = props;
    return (<div>React component:
        <b>{record.name}</b>
    </div>)
}

export default DemoTooltip
```

and:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const DemoEventTip = props => {
    const { data } = props;
    return <div>
        <i>{data.eventRecord.name}:</i>
        <b>{data.startText} -&gt; {data.endText}</b>
    </div>
}

export default DemoEventTip
```

### React component in Widget

A React component can be used as `html` in Widget, for example:

```javascript
const coreConfig = {
    bbar : {
        items : [{
            type : 'widget',
            html : <DemoWidget/>
        }]
    },
```

and:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const DemoWidget = props => {
    const title = 'Click me and watch the console output';
    const style = {
        cursor : 'pointer'
    };
    const handleClick = event => {
        console.log(event);
    }

    return <div title={title} style={style} onClick={handleClick}>React Demo Widget</div>
}

export default DemoWidget;
```

## Configs, properties and events

All Bryntum React Wrappers support the full set of the public configs, properties and events of a component.

## Features

Features are suffixed with `Feature` and act as both configs and properties for `BryntumCoreComponent`. They are
mapped to the corresponding API features of the `instance`.

This is a list of all `BryntumCore` features:

## The native Bryntum Core instance

It is important to know that the React component that we may even call "core" is _not_ the native Bryntum Core
instance, it is a wrapper or an interface between the React application and the Bryntum Core itself.

The properties and features are propagated from the wrapper down to the underlying Bryntum Core instance but there
might be the situations when you want to access the Bryntum Core directly. That is fully valid approach and you are
free to do it.

### Accessing the Bryntum Core instance

If you need to access Bryntum Core instance, you can do like this:

```javascript
const coreRef = useRef();

useEffect(() => {
    // the instance is available as
    console.log(coreRef.current.instance);
}, [])

return <BryntumCore ref={coreRef} {...coreConfig} />
```

## Using Bryntum Core themes

For the scheduler styling you must also import a CSS file that contains a theme for Bryntum Core. There are
two main ways of importing the theme.

### Using single theme

The easiest way is to import the CSS file in your `App.js` or in `App.scss`.

In `App.js` you would import **one** of the following:

```javascript
import '@bryntum/core/core.classic-dark.css';
import '@bryntum/core/core.classic-light.css';
import '@bryntum/core/core.classic.css';
import '@bryntum/core/core.material.css';
import '@bryntum/core/core.stockholm.css';
```

The syntax is slightly different in `App.scss`; use **one** of the following:

```scss
@import '~@bryntum/core/core.classic-dark.css';
@import '~@bryntum/core/core.classic-light.css';
@import '~@bryntum/core/core.classic.css';
@import '~@bryntum/core/core.material.css';
@import '~@bryntum/core/core.stockholm.css';
```

<div class="note">

Importing theme in <strong>App.scss</strong> file is recommended because this way we keep all styling-related code together in one
file

</div>

### Selecting from multiple themes

Theme switching can be implemented with the help of the `<BryntumThemeCombo />` component. It has to be imported
as any other component before it is used, for example:

```javascript
import { BryntumThemeCombo,

...
}
from
'@bryntum/scheduler-react';

// ... other code

return (
    // ... other components
    <BryntumThemeCombo/>
    // ... other components
);
```

CSS and fonts files that contain themes must be accessible by the server in any subdirectory of the public server
root in `themes` and `themes/fonts`. The easiest way of putting them there is to copy the files automatically during
`postinstall` process in `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
"postinstall": "postinstall"
},
"postinstall": {
"node_modules/@bryntum/core/*.css*": "copy public/themes/",
"node_modules/@bryntum/core/fonts": "copy public/themes/fonts"
},
"devDependencies": {
"postinstall": "~0.7.0"
}
},
```

<div class="note">

Use <strong>npm install --save-dev --save-prefix=~ postinstall</strong> to install the required <strong>postinstall</strong> package or
add it manually to <strong>package.json</strong>

</div>

The last part is to add the default theme link to the head of `public/index.html`:

```html
<head>
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="%PUBLIC_URL%/themes/core.stockholm.css"
        data-bryntum-theme
    />
</head>
```

<div class="note">

<strong>data-bryntum-theme</strong> is mandatory because <strong>BryntumThemeCombo</strong> relies on it

</div>

<div class="note">

If you adjust location of themes and fonts, adjust it in both <strong>package.json</strong> and in <strong>index.html</strong>, for example
<strong>my-resources/themes/</strong> and <strong>my-resources/themes/fonts</strong>. No other configuration is needed

</div>

## Loading components dynamically with Next.js

Bryntum components are client-side only, they do not support server-side rendering. Therefore they must be loaded with
`ssr` turned off. Furthermore, the life cycle of dynamically loaded components is different from normal React
components hence the following steps are needed.

The `BryntumCore` must be wrapped in another component so that React `refs` will continue to work. To implement it
create a folder outside of Next.js `pages`, for example `components`, and put this extra wrapper there.

Sample code for `components/Core.js`:

```jsx
/**
 * A simple wrap around BryntumCore for ref to work
 */
import { BryntumCore } from '@bryntum/core-react';

export default function Core({ coreRef, ...props }) {
    return <BryntumCore {...props} ref={coreRef}/>
}
```

The above component can then be loaded dynamically with this code:

```jsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
import { useRef } from 'react';

const Core = dynamic(
    () => import("../components/Core.js"), { ssr : false }
);

const MyComponent = () => {
    const coreRef = useRef();

    const clickHandler = function(e) {
        // This will log the Bryntum Core native instance after it has been loaded
        console.log(coreRef.current?.instance);
    }

    return (
        <>
            <button onClick={clickHandler}>ref test</button>
            <Core
                coreRef={coreRef}
                // other props
            />
        </>
    )
}
```

## Best practices

There are many possible ways of creating and building React applications. We are using Vite to create our React examples
as it has proven to offer higher efficiency and better performance in development.

We recommend to set up a React application with Vite from scratch but if you take our demo as the basis, please do not
forget to clean it up from imports, resources, css files and rules that are not needed.

Our examples also use resources from `@bryntum/demo-resources`, for example `scss/example-vite.scss`, fonts and
images that are used to style demo's header, logo, etc. These are generally not needed in your application because you
have different logo, colors, layout of header, etc.

Also we do not recommend to copy the downloaded and unzipped Bryntum Core to your project tree not only because it
would bloat the size but mainly because it can fool the IDE to propose auto-imports from the wrong places.

If you decide to copy the files from Bryntum download to your project, always copy selectively only the source files you
need, not the whole distribution.

Please refer to this [Quick start](#Core/guides/quick-start/react.md) guide for creating your application.

### Best practices for configuration management

Configuration options can be passed to the wrapper component by passing them as React props. Two approaches for managing
your configuration are listed below. You can use both of these approaches at the same time as well, just make sure you're
not setting the same configuration in multiple places.

#### External Configuration for static settings:

For configurations that remain constant, such as column setups or widget options, it's best to define these outside of 
your React component. This approach minimizes re-rendering overhead, and keeps components tidy. For example:

Sample code for `App.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BryntumCore } from '@bryntum/core-react';
import { coreConfig } from './AppConfig'

export const App = () => {
    return (
        <BryntumCore
            {...coreConfig}
            // other props, event handlers, etc
        />
    );
}
```

Sample code for `AppConfig.js`:

```javascript
export const coreConfig = {
    tooltip : "My cool Bryntum Core component",
    // Bryntum Core config options
};
```

#### State-managed configuration for dynamic settings:

When your configuration needs to adapt based on the component's state or props, encapsulate your configuration within 
the component using React's `useState` hook. This ensures that your configuration maintains its reference across 
re-renders, preventing unnecessary calculations. For example:

Sample code for `App.js`:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { BryntumCore } from '@bryntum/core-react';

export const App = () => {

    const [start, setStart] = useState(new Date());

    const [coreConfig] = useState({
        startDate: start
        // Bryntum Core config options
    })

    return (
        <BryntumCore
            {...coreConfig}
            // other props, event handlers, etc
        />
    );
}
```
