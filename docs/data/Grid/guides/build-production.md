# Build a production grade application with the licensed distribution

Bryntum offers trial distributions for you to experience our products and build your own demos.

However, to use the full potential of our products and use them legitimately, you will be required to acquire a licensed
distribution.

If you have not done so, please visit the [Bryntum Customer Zone](https://customerzone.bryntum.com).

## Migrate to the licensed distribution

Download a licensed version of your product distribution from your
[Bryntum Customer Zone](https://customerzone.bryntum.com). You'll notice the distribution contains source files and
additional interesting material that we will describe in detail further down.

If you are using npm, you will need to login to our private registry with your customer details.
Visit our [Npm Repository Guide](#Grid/guides/npm-repository.md) For more information.

## Performance Optimization

There are many techniques to further improve both the loading time and execution time of your application and as a
consequence, the User Experience.
Some techniques described below require a fully licensed distribution but not all of them.

First, grid row elements are reused when scrolling, meaning that you should not manipulate row and cell dom elements
directly (do it from renderers instead).

### Vanilla Javascript applications

#### Using thin files

If you are using multiple Bryntum products on the same page, you want to import them to avoid downloading the shared
code and styling more than once. We recommend using thin bundles for JavaScript and CSS to reduce the amount of code and
CSS to download. Just replace your js and css files with .thin.js and .thin.css files.

#### Using minified files

The fully licensed version of the product comes with minified versions of Javascript and CSS files. Just replace your js
and css files with .min.js and .min.css files.

<div class="note">

thin files are also available in a minified format. See the min-thin folder provided in the distribution.

#### Importing EcmaScript modules from sources

The fully licensed distribution also provides you with the opportunity to build your Vanilla JS application using the
component source files directly.

This is the most efficient way from a code size perspective, as your bundle will only include the JS modules actually
used by the Grid codebase.

In your application code, just import the classes you need from their source file. All source files are located
under `lib/` and they all offer a default export. Please note that if you want to support older browsers you may need to
transpile and bundle your code since ES modules are only supported in modern browsers.

```javascript
import Grid from '../lib/Grid/view/Grid.js';

const grid = new Grid({/*...*/})
```

For more information about using source files, please visit the
[dedicated guide](#Grid/guides/gettingstarted/sources.md).

<div class="note">

You can also have a look at the code of our examples since almost all use this technique.

#### Use a module bundler

We strongly recommend that you build your application using your favorite module bundler so it can be loaded from a web
browser with no reference to your local environment. If you don't have any, we suggest you learn more
about [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for example.

### React applications

#### Loading components dynamically with Next.js

Bryntum components are client-side only, they do not support server-side rendering. Therefore they must be loaded
with `ssr` turned off. Furthermore, the life cycle of dynamically loaded components is different from normal React
components hence the following steps are needed.

The `BryntumGrid` must be wrapped in another component so that React `refs` will continue to work. To implement it,
create a folder outside of Next.js `pages`, for example `components`, and put this extra wrapper there.

Sample code for `components/Grid.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * A simple wrap around BryntumGrid for ref to work
 */
import { BryntumGrid } from '@bryntum/grid-react';

export default function Grid({GridRef, ...props }) {
    return <BryntumGrid {...props} ref={GridRef} />
}
```

The above component can then be loaded dynamically with this code:

```javascript
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
import { useRef } from 'react';

const Grid = dynamic(
  () => import("../components/Grid.js"), {ssr: false}
);

const MyComponent = () => {
  const GridRef = useRef();

  const clickHandler = function(e) {
    // This will log the Bryntum Grid native instance after it has been loaded
    console.log(GridRef.current?.instance);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={clickHandler}>ref test</button>
      <Grid
        GridRef={GridRef}
        // other props
      />
    </>
```
