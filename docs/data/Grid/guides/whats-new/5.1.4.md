# What's new in Grid v5.1.4

## RowReorder feature enhanced

The `RowReorder` feature now has a `dropOnLeaf` config which in a `TreeGrid` enables creation of parents simply by
drag and dropping a row onto a leaf. The feature has also been visually updated - when dragging and targeting into a row
the targeted row will get a border and a different background. The arrow which previously indicated to which parent a
row would be added, has been removed.

## Asynchronous store methods for sorting, grouping and filtering

Remote server data loading for store can be configured with [sortParamName](#Core/data/AjaxStore#config-sortParamName) 
and [filterParamName](#Core/data/AjaxStore#config-filterParamName) to pass sorters and filters for loading pre-sorted or
pre-filtered data from a remote server.

In case you have configured remote loading, then the methods listed below will now return a `Promise`.
Note that the methods return `null` if store doesn't use remote loading.

From [StoreSort](#Core/data/mixin/StoreSort) mixin:
[addSorter](#Core/data/mixin/StoreSort#function-addSorter),
[clearSorters](#Core/data/mixin/StoreSort#function-clearSorters),
[removeSorter](#Core/data/mixin/StoreSort#function-removeSorter),
[sort](#Core/data/mixin/StoreSort#function-sort).

From [StoreGroup](#Core/data/mixin/StoreGroup) mixin:
[clearGroupers](#Core/data/mixin/StoreGroup#function-clearGroupers),
[group](#Core/data/mixin/StoreGroup#function-group),
[setGroupers](#Core/data/mixin/StoreGroup#function-setGroupers).

From [StoreFilter](#Core/data/mixin/StoreFilter) mixin:
[addFilter](#Core/data/mixin/StoreFilter#function-addFilter),
[clearFilters](#Core/data/mixin/StoreFilter#function-clearFilters),
[filter](#Core/data/mixin/StoreFilter#function-filter),
[filterBy](#Core/data/mixin/StoreFilter#function-filterBy),
[removeFilter](#Core/data/mixin/StoreFilter#function-removeFilter).

**Code sample**

```javascript
await store.sort(...);
await store.group(...);
await store.filter(...);
```
