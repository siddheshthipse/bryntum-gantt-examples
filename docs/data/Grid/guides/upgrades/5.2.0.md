# Upgrade guide for Grid v5.2.0

## Deprecated DomHelper.up()

The `DomHelper.up()` function was deprecated, since all supported browsers has native `element.closest()` which 
accomplishes the same thing.

**Old code:**

```javascript
const rowElement = DomHelper.up(cellElement, '.b-grid-row');
```

**New code:**

```javascript
const rowElement = cellElement.closest('.b-grid-row');
```

## Asynchronous cell editing

[CellEdit](#Grid/feature/CellEdit) feature [startEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-startEditing) and
[finishEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-finishEditing) methods are now `async`.

[finishEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-finishEditing) and
[cancelEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-cancelEditing) methods are now exposed on Grid.

**Old code:**

```javascript
if (grid.startEditing(...)) {
    // Do something
}
if (grid.features.cellEdit.finishEditing()) {
    // Do something
}
```

**New code:**

```javascript
if (await grid.startEditing(...)) {
    // Do something
}
if (await grid.finishEditing()) {
    // Do something
}
```
