# Upgrade guide for Grid v5.3.7

## `Sort` feature now creates sorting icon element in header cell.

The CSS to create and show the arrow icon to indicate sort direction is now a `:before` pseudo
element of a child element of the header text element. There is now an addressable `.b-sort-icon`
node inside the cell which may be targeted by application CSS.

In previous versions, the arrow icon was a `:before` pseudo element of the header text element and not
addressable by application code or CSS.
