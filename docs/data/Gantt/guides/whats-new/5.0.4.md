# What's new in Gantt v5.0.4

## Long distance projects support

By default the Gantt supports projects of 5 years duration max roughly. That limit was hardcoded in some private code.
And in this release [ProjectModel](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel) has got new
[maxCalendarRange](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#config-maxCalendarRange) config allowing to adjust this limit.

The value should be provided in milliseconds and should be configured in case the project deals with long tasks:

```javascript
new Gantt({
    project : {
        // adjust calendar iteration limit to 10 years roughly:
        // 10 years expressed in ms
        maxCalendarRange : 10 * 365 * 24 * 3600000,
        /* ... */
    }
});
```
