# What's new in Gantt v5.1.2

## Keyboard shortcuts

Gantt now supports using keyboard shortcuts for indenting and outdenting tasks. Defaults are `Alt + Shift + Right` for
indenting, and `Alt + Shift + Left` for outdenting. Note that the `Alt` key matches the `Option` key on Mac.
Configurable with the [KeyMap](#Core/widget/mixin/KeyMap) mixin. There is a
new [guide](#Gantt/guides/customization/keymap.md) describing how to customize.
