# Upgrade guide for Gantt v2.1.6

## Angular, React and Vue `ganttEngine` has been renamed to `ganttInstance`

To avoid confusing the calculating engine with the instance of Bryntum Gantt, `ganttEngine` has been renamed
to `ganttInstance`. The change is backwards compatible hence applications using `ganttEngine` will still work, but with
deprecation warning in the console.

Change all occurrences of `ganttEngine` to `ganttInstance` in your Angular, React or Vue application to get rid of the
warning and to make the application consistent with Bryntum Gantt wrapper naming.
