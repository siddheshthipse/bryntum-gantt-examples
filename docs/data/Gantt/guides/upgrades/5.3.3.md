# Upgrade guide for Gantt v5.3.3

## Angular View Engine wrappers

New `@bryntum/gantt-angular-view` is designed to work with Angular 11 and older versions, which use the View Engine
for rendering. If you are using one of the legacy Angular versions, please follow these steps to use the package:

Install the package using npm:

```shell
npm install @bryntum/gantt-angular-view@5.3.3
```

Import the component in your Angular application:

```typescript
import { BryntumGanttComponent } from '@bryntum/gantt-angular-view';
```

Do not forget to remove previously used `@bryntum/gantt-angular` package which requires Angular 12 or newer version.

Please check [Angular integration guide](#Gantt/guides/integration/angular/guide.md#ivy-and-view-engine-wrappers) for
additional information.
