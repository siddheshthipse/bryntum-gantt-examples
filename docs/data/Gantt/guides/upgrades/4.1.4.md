# Upgrade guide for Gantt v4.1.4

## Task milestones CSS classes changed

CSS classes for baseline elements changed slightly so make sure to revise any styling you have used based on
`b-baseline-milestone` CSS class (removed). Each baseline task now has `b-task-baseline` and milestones have
`b-task-baseline-milestone`.
