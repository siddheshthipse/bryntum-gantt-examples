# Bryntum Scheduler Pro version history

## 5.6.11 - 2024-05-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* A new static boolean property, `Widget.accessibility` was added, which, when set to `true` causes tooltips to
  be activated on `focus` in addition to `mouseover` ([#5539](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5539))
* Vanilla JavaScript documentation has a new section on Multiple Products, showing how to use multiple components
  in a single page using `thin` components ([#8756](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8756))
* Project has a new config called `includeChildrenInRemoveRequest`, that controls if a remove request includes the id of
  a removed parent and all its children, or just the id of the removed parent ([#8099](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8099))

### API CHANGES

* After a docs regression, several APIs flagged to be hidden in subclasses were still visible in the docs. These APIs
  are now correctly hidden ([#9140](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/9140))

## 5.6.9 - 2024-04-09

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Now it is possible to specify the maximum units capacity of the resource, using `maxUnits` field. Default value
  is 100%, but if resource represents a team of several people `maxUnits` can be increased accordingly.
  This field is taken into account in the resource histogram and resource utilization widgets ([#833](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/833))
* The rules of calendar intervals prioritization in case of their intersection have been properly documented. Now the
  index of the interval in the dataset is also taken into account. Please refer to the updated Calendars guide and
  priority field documentation for the details ([#8754](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8754))
* `ProjectModel.toJSON()` now includes data from all registered `crudStores` ([#8803](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8803))

   method. Please check the config docs for more details ([#8814](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8814))

### API CHANGES

* A change in Scheduler Pro `v5.3.0` fell out of the upgrade guide, repeating it here: `CalendarModel` class `intervals`
  field definition has been changed to behave as a store when performing CRUD operations. Please check "Upgrade guide"
  for the details

## 5.6.6 - 2024-01-31

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Bumped built-in FontAwesome Free to version `6.5.1`
* All frameworks demo applications have been verified and updated to be compatible with Node.js 20
* When editing very long tasks where the task bar extends outside the visible viewport, only the nearest 100 pixels of
  the bar are scrolled into the viewport rather than attempting to scroll the whole width into view. The minimum width
  to scroll in may be configured in the `taskEdit` feature using the `minEditSize` config property ([#8315](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8315))

### API CHANGES

* To boost record creation performance, records now cache their `id` (it is accessed very frequently, helps performance
  a bit) and join their store(s) in a more efficient way. As a side effect, a record no longer has a `stores` array
  prior to joining a store, previously it was there as an empty array from start. We don't think this will affect any
  code, but wanted to share the change in case it does
* [DEPRECATED] [ANGULAR] [REACT] [VUE] `BryntumProjectModel` framework wrapper will be removed starting from `6.0.0`
  version. Use `BryntumSchedulerProProjectModel` instead. Check the upgrade guide for the details

## 5.6.0 - 2023-10-26

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* When dragging events in Scheduler Pro, the dates shown in the tooltip now take non-working time into account. This
  means that the tooltip now more accurately indicate the dates that will be assigned on drop
* This release introduces a new set of npm packages and framework components, that allows combining multiple Bryntum
  products in the same application. These packages contain the product specific code only, as opposed to the current
  packages that has all code for the products each product builds upon (for example Scheduler contains Grid & Core).
  The new packages are called `thin` packages, and moving forward it will be the recommended way of using Bryntum
  products in npm based applications (for all supported frameworks). See the "What's new" guide for more information
* `@bryntum/schedulerpro-thin` bundle includes scss theme files in `sass/themes` folder ([#7445](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/7445))
* Nested events are now by default scheduled relative to their parent event. Previously they were positioned relative
  to their parent event initially, but when the parent was moved intersecting non-working time the relative position was
  lost. This is implemented as a new `delayFromParent` field (optional to specify), which behind the scenes is used as
  a constraint, taking non-working time into account ([#6821](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6821))
* Scheduler now suspends UI refreshes during direct application calls to `project.loadCrudManagerData()`, only
  refreshing once after the data has been applied ([#7246](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/7246))
* [TypeScript] Functions and events declarations in typings were improved to contain all available parameters and return
  type ([#6961](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6961), [#4456](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4456))
* Added a `Print` feature based on `PdfExport` feature which allows using browser print dialog and not rely on backend
  ([#6218](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6218))
* Scheduler Pro now supports dependencies between nested events, on display in the new `nested-events-dependencies`
  example ([#7211](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/7211))
* [REACT][SharePoint] Added a new React based SharePoint web part demo. It shows how to integrate Scheduler Pro in

  changes behind the scenes to pave the way for future support for live updates in Scheduler Pro and Gantt.

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We have refactored a few features and changed their prototype chain. If you are importing those features directly, or
  are extending them, you need to use correct base class and import path:
  `Grid/feature/RowReorder` ->  `Scheduler/feature/RowReorder`,
  `Grid/feature/CellEdit` -> `SchedulerPro/feature/CellEdit`,
  `Scheduler/feature/Dependencies` -> `SchedulerPro/feature/Dependencies`
* [REACT] New Drag unplanned tasks demo (React + Vite) shows how to drag unplanned tasks from a list
  onto the Scheduler Pro component. The demo is located in `frameworks/react-vite/drag-unplanned-tasks` folder
* [ANGULAR] New Drag unplanned tasks demo (Angular) showing how to drag unplanned tasks from a list
  onto the Scheduler Pro component. The demo is located in `frameworks/angular/drag-unplanned-tasks` folder

* [#7164](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/7164) - Action column icons missing margin in Scheduler Pro

## 5.4.1 - 2023-07-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We have created a public repository to showcase Salesforce demos. All previous demos are merged into one Lightning
  Application which is easy to install to a new scratch org. You can find more information in updated guides and in this
  repository: https://github.com/bryntum/bryntum-salesforce-showcase#bryntum-salesforce-showcase
* We have created a public Salesforce org where this app is preinstalled. You can find link to it and login credentials
  on the updated examples page

### BUG FIXES

* [#6077](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6077) - [TypeScript] `Model` constructors should allow second param
* [#7099](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/7099) - Dependency creation validates not correct when move cursor fast

## 5.4.0 - 2023-06-30

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* This release introduces a new `TimelineHistogram` class which implements a grid with histogram charts displayed for
  rows in the timeaxis section. Please check the new
  [Timeline histogram demo](https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/examples-scheduler/timelinehistogram/) and the
  "Timeline histogram" guide for more details
* The release also includes refactored `ResourceHistogram` and `ResourceUtilization` views which now better support
  `TreeGroup` and `Group` features and provide some additional APIs for customization. For more details please check
  new "Resource histogram" and "Resource utilization" guides and see the updated `resourcehistogram` and
  `resourceutilization` examples
* `Widget` has a new config, `maximizeOnMobile` which takes effect only on `floating` widgets on a mobile device. It
  causes the widget to be maximized instead of positioned in order to accommodate the mobile virtual keyboard. This will
  make event editing much easier to use on mobile devices ([#6522](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6522))
* On mobile devices, `type : 'checkbox'` is rendered as a `slidetoggle` widget. The API and value is the same, it is
  just a more appropriate UI for the platform
* The `NestedEvents` feature now supports deeper nesting of events, by specifying the new `maxNesting` config (it
  defaults to one level). Although it technically supports any depth, we do not recommend going deeper than 2 levels for
  the UI to be comprehensible ([#6030](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6030))
* For a slightly better docs experience for most users, the docs browser now by default hides some more obscure APIs
  normally only used when implementing own widgets and features. Advanced users in need of these APIs can still opt in
  to see them using the `Show` menu in the docs browser

### API CHANGES

* The `ScaleColumn` class has been moved from Pro to regular Scheduler classes. This should not affect your application
  unless it imports the class from its individual file (not the case for the vast majority of customers). The
  distribution still includes `SchedulerPro/column/ScaleColumn.js` file which is now an empty wrapper importing the
  class from its new location. The wrapper is there till the next major release so please update your code and import
  the file from its new location if needed ([#6176](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6176))

* `ResourceNonWorkingTime` now supports showing the `name` interval field in the rendered element ([#6493](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6493))
* [ANGULAR] Bryntum Scheduler Pro now ships with two npm Angular wrapper packages to support different versions of
  Angular framework. Existing `@bryntum/schedulerpro-angular` package is now designed to work with Angular 12 and newer
  versions, which use the IVY rendering engine. New `@bryntum/schedulerpro-angular-view` package is designed to work
  with Angular 11 and older versions, which use the View Engine rendering. Check Upgrading and Angular integration
  guides in documentation for more information ([#6270](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6270))
* [ANGULAR] `angular-11` demo has been added to show use of `@bryntum/schedulerpro-angular-view` package with

## 5.3.0 - 2023-03-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* CSS changes in Scheduler has cut the size of Scheduler Pro's standalone CSS-bundles roughly in half. See Schedulers
  upgrade guide for more information
* Added basic support for recurring events, see "What's new" for more information. And be sure to try it out in the new
  `recurrence` demo ([#792](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/792))
* Support for Time zone conversion has been added to all Bryntum scheduling products. Simply set a IANA time zone
  identifier as value for the `timeZone` config and that's it. But, since time zones is not supported natively in
  JavaScript we strongly recommend to read our Time zone guide ([#1533](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1533))
* Added `Versions` feature, enabling capturing snapshots of projects together with a detailed changelog
* Localization demos updated to show up-to-date localization approach
* Event model has got new `schedulingMode`, `effort` and `effortDriven` fields. The fields add support for a new
  scheduling mode in which user provided effort gets distributed across the event duration.
  Please check the new `effort` demo to see how it works
* `AjaxHelper.fetch` now supports using request body to pass parameters for non-GET requests. Please check
  `addQueryParamsToBody` argument in the method documentation ([#2855](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2855))
* Lots (but not all) of the not so informative `object` types in our TypeScript typings have been replaced with more
  specific types. Objects that in our JavaScript are used as maps are now declared as `Record<keyType, valueType>`, and
  for functions that accept object arguments many are replaced with anonymous type declarations, such as
  `{ foo: string, bar: number }` (Partially fixed [#5176](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5176))
* Added new "Nested events configuration options" Angular demo. Demo is located in
  `examples/frameworks/angular/nested-events-configuration` folder ([#5188](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5188))
* While resizing the `PercentBar`, the owning component now trigger `percentBarDragStart`, `percentBarDrag`
  and `percentBarDrop` events. The task record is also updated in realtime triggering continuous UI updates for a nicer
  UX ([#6146](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6146))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] `LocaleManager.registerLocale` and `LocaleManager.extendLocale` are deprecated.
  `LocaleHelper.publishLocale` should be used instead.
* When configuring a SchedulerPro with a time zone at initialization, and there's also a `startDate` and/or a `endDate`
  initially, those days will be treated as in local system time zone and will therefore be converted to the configured
  time zone. Previously (in `5.3.0-alpha-1` and `5.3.0-beta-1`) those dates was treated as in the provided time zone
* The default value for `ResourceHistogram`'s `effortFormat` was changed from `0` to `0.#`, to round values to one
  decimal place. Previously it was not rounding at all

### LOCALE UPDATES

* Locales format and process for applying locales have been simplified
* New locales for 31 languages have been added. Currently available languages are listed in the localization guide
  (Guides/Customization/Localization)

### BUG FIXES

* [#5889](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5889) - Events are not rendered according to the timezone when scheduler has a timezone
* [#5981](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5981) - Scrolling close to edges hides `highlightEventCalendars`
* [#6018](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6018) - Wrong position of highlighted region when `taskRecord` is set
* [#6020](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6020) - Highlighted task timespan height not adjusting with the height of the rows
* [#6156](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6156) - `eventRecord.set` only works first time for preamble/postamble
* [#6260](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6260) - Milestone is rendered incorrectly
* [#6271](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6271) - Timeline enables eventEdit feature if any features config provided

## 5.2.10 - 2023-02-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Added a `trackProjectModelChanges` config to the `ProjectModel` to optionally track own changes of the `ProjectModel`
  ([#5355](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5355))

### API CHANGES

* Recently browsers have added support for Unicode 15, which changes the output of `Intl.DateTimeFormat` when
  formatting time to include `AM`/`PM`. Those browsers now use "thin space" (`\u202f`) instead of regular space. This
  affects the `DateHelper.format()` function, but likely you do not need to take any action in your application. It
  also affects `DateHelper.parse()`, which has been updated to support the new unicode space ([#6193](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6193))

### BUG FIXES

* [#6112](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6112) - Exception is thrown after rejecting a conflicting change
* [#6114](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6114) - `scrollEventIntoView` doesn't handle nested events

* [#6147](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6147) - Undo/redo adding a calendar crashes

## 5.2.9 - 2023-01-30

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `TaskEditor's` `Advanced` tab's combos has been made wider which required some additional styling and some fields
  have been rearranged as well. If your app is customizing the `Advanced` tab, you should check that your customization

## 5.2.4 - 2022-11-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We recently launched a new homepage over at [bryntum.com](https://bryntum.com), and have now slightly updated the
  styling for demos and docs to better match it (new logo, new header color, new font). Please note that this is not a
  change to our themes, only the look of the demos, and it won't affect your application

### BUG FIXES

* [#5551](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5551) - Store `allRecords` includes group footers twice

## 5.2.2 - 2022-11-08

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The behaviour of the `store.data` getter will be changed in 6.0. Currently, it returns the **initial**
  raw dataset, in 6.0 it will be changed to have the more expected behaviour of returning the data objects for the
  **current** state instead. See Grid's upgrade guide for more information ([#5499](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5499))

## 5.2.1 - 2022-10-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Documentation for `EventModel` mistakenly listed support for `effort`, related fields and functions. The concept
  currently only exists in Gantt, docs has been cleaned up. ([#5411](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5411))

### BUG FIXES

* [#2605](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2605) - Setting new resources to the store fails when all resources are filtered out
* [#4392](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4392) - Error when using store instance in `ProjectModel` definition

* [#5435](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5435) - Error after call `loadInlineData` with resource tree structure

## 5.2.0 - 2022-10-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Scheduler Pro has gained built-in support for segmented events, by using the new `EventSegments`,
  `EventSegmentDrag` and `EventSegmentResize` features. The features cover splitting events to segments, rendering of
  such events and individual segments dragging Please check the new `split-events` demo to see how it works
  ([#2975](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2975))
* A new widget, ViewPresetCombo, is available to Scheduler, SchedulerPro and Gantt. Put it in the toolbar, and it will
  provide easy-to-setup view switching. It uses the built-in ViewPresets functionality which is easily customized
  ([#4539](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4539))
* Menu has a `separator` config to make it easier to visually separate menu items
* The responsive state objects used in the `responsive` config of the `Responsive` mixin now support a `once` property
  to allow configs to only be set on first activation of the state
* The `Core.helper.DateHelper` class has a new method `formatRange` method which can format date ranges, as well as new
  formatting options for week numbers
* A new `EventNonWorkingTime` feature was added to Scheduler. When enabled in Scheduler Pro, the combined calendar for
  an event (a merge of project / resource + event calendars) is visualized by shading the parts of an event that
  intersects non-working time. Can be tried in the new `event-non-working-time` demo
* PdfExport feature is refactored to render content directly. This significantly improves performance and robustness by
  eliminating component scrolling. This behavior is enabled by default. You can revert to the old behavior by setting
  `enableDirectRendering` config on the export feature to `false` ([#4449](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4449))
* `ResourceHistogram` has got a new `generateScalePoints` event that allows customizing its scale points at runtime
  ([#5025](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5025))

### API CHANGES

* `EventModel` has new `ignoreResourceCalendar` boolean field. When field is set to `true` the event will not take its
  assigned resource calendars into account and will perform according to its own calendar only ([#3349](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3349))

### LOCALE UPDATES

* Added localization for the new event split functionality, keys `EventSegments.splitEvent` and
  `EventSegments.renameSegment`

### BUG FIXES

* [#4096](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4096) - CalendarIntervalMixin class uses hardcoded date field formats
* [#5241](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5241) - Cannot reach dependency terminals for segmented events
* [#5243](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5243) - Task editor too narrow in classic themes
* [#5290](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5290) - Error on triggering `zoomToFit` on `ResourceHistogram`

## 5.1.5 - 2022-10-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* New records are assigned a generated `id` if none is provided. The generated `id` is meant to be temporary (a
  phantom `id`), and should be replaced by the backend on commit. Previously the `id` was based on a global counter
  incremented with each assignment. That simplistic scheme assured no two records got the same `id` during a session,
  but if an application serialized the generated `id` (note, they should not) and then reloaded it, it would eventually
  collide with a new generated `id`. To prevent this, the generated `id`s are now based on a random UUID instead
* Stores now by default show a warning on console when loading records that has generated `id`s, as a reminder that it
  should be replaced by the backend on commit

### BUG FIXES

* [#4645](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4645) - Improve error message "Bryntum bundle included twice"
* [#4654](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4654) - [REACT] Bryntum widget wrappers don't accept all component properties in React 18
* [#5352](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5352) - Exception thrown when refreshing the data with event selected

## 5.1.4 - 2022-09-29

### BUG FIXES

* [#4374](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4374) - Console error if return false on preventable `beforeAdd` event on dependency store
* [#5050](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5050) - Events are not rendered correctly after exporting to PDF
* [#5170](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5170) - When first region has width and last region is collapsed, Scheduler Pro doesn't resize with container
* [#5196](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5196) - Task editor in Scheduler Pro gets empty when opened too fast after closing
* [#5199](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5199) - When `resourceTimeRanges` feature enabled description is displayed twice

## 5.1.3 - 2022-09-09

### BUG FIXES

* [#415](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/415) - Improve docs on formatting currency values on `NumberField`
* [#3680](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3680) - Support Salesforce Winter 22 release
* [#5133](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5133) - Custom layout function scope should have a reference to the scheduler

## 5.1.2 - 2022-08-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Configs that accept configuration options for a widget (or other class) are now (mostly) documented to accept a typed
  config object rather than a plain object. For example instead of `{Object} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`,
  it is now `{TooltipConfig} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`. This improves our TypeScript typings (transforms
  to `Partial<TooltipConfig>` in typings) when using such configs, but also improves our docs by linking to the configs
  of the type
* Added a config to allow State Tracking Manager to ignore remote changes coming in a sync response. This allows user
  to only undo/redo local changes (`ignoreRemoteChangesInSTM` config on the ProjectModel) ([#5083](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5083))

### BUG FIXES

* [#4943](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4943) - Changing the time by dragging an event triggering an error
* [#4965](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4965) - Dependency creation still working when `readOnly` is `true`

* [#5028](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5028) - UI does not refresh when certain fields are changed
* [#5056](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5056) - Project mutes events in stores not managed by the engine

## 5.1.1 - 2022-07-28

### BUG FIXES

* [#3427](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3427) - Infinite sync loop if `percentDone` value is incorrect
* [#4963](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4963) - Undoing two scheduled nested events causes crash

## 5.1.0 - 2022-07-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Scheduler Pro has gained built-in support for nested events, by using a tree EventStore and the new NestedEvents
  feature. On display in the new `nested-events-configuration` and `nested-events-drag-from-grid` demos, as well as in
  the updated `nested-events` demo ([#1519](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1519), [#3564](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3564))
* Our TypeScript typings for string types that have a predefined set of alternatives was improved to only accept
  those alternatives. For example previously the `dock` config which was previously declared as `dock: string` is now
  `dock : 'top'|'right'|'bottom'|'left'`
* Create React App templates now available
* Configuring the crud manager functionality of the project was made a little easier by introducing shortcuts for
  setting load and sync urls using the new `loadUrl` and `syncUrl` configs
* Updated the built-in version of FontAwesome Free to `6.1.1`
* `KeyMap` is a mixin that allows for standardized and customizable keyboard shortcuts functionality. `KeyMap` is by
  default  mixed in to `Widget` and therefore available to all `Widget`'s child classes. There is a new guide
  **Guides/Customization/Keyboard shortcuts** describing how to customize currently integrated keyboard shortcuts
  ([#4300](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4300), [#4313](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4313), [#4328](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4328))
* Project optionally allows `sync()` calls without local changes, to retrieve changes from the backend. Configure
  `forceSync : true` to enable this new behaviour ([#4575](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4575))

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] [ANGULAR] Angular wrappers now use the more modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd
  bundle. Hence application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and
  performance ([#2786](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2786))
* [BREAKING] `schedulerpro.lite.umd.js` bundle is no longer available
* [BREAKING] WebComponents has been removed from `schedulerpro.module.js` ES modules bundle. New bundle with
  WebComponents is `schedulerpro.wc.module.js`

### BUG FIXES

* [WRAPPERS] `ProjectModel` wrapper component reference can now be used as `project` parameter for Bryntum Scheduler Pro
  wrapper component in Angular and Vue applications ([#4238](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4238))
* [WRAPPERS] Scheduler Pro has a new `ProjectModel` framework wrapper available for React, Vue and Angular. It
  simplifies sharing data between multiple Bryntum components ([#4382](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4382))

  responses from the backend and outputs a message on console if the format isn't valid. This is helpful during the
  development phase, but can be turned off in production
* New Vue 2/3 wrapper config option `relayStoreEvents` (defaults to `false`). When set to `true`, the events fired by
  stores are relayed to the Bryntum Grid instance

## 5.0.2 - 2022-04-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `beforeTaskEdit`, `beforeTaskSave` and `beforeTaskDelete` events triggered by the TaskEdit feature now handle
  async flows. Use async / await in your listener or return a Promise and it will be awaited before execution
  continues. Useful for example to ask for a confirmation on save etc ([#4421](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4421))

  includes lots of new demos, an EventBuffer feature (for travel time), a ResourceUtilization widget as bug fixes and
  other enhancements requested by our community. A big thanks to our customers who helped us with testing our alpha &
  beta versions
* You are most welcome to join us on March 16th, at 9am PST (6pm CET) for a 5.0 walkthrough webinar, demonstrating all
  the shiny new features

* We hope you will enjoy this release and we are looking forward to hearing your feedback of what you would like us to
  develop next

*/ Mats Bryntse, CEO @Bryntum

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Added a new Resource Utilization view displaying resource allocation. Please check its demo for details ([#2348](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2348))
* With this release Scheduler Pro starts displaying a popup informing users of scheduling conflicts, cycles and calendar
  misconfigurations. The popup allows user to pick an appropriate resolution for the case at hand. On the data level the
  cases are indicated by new events triggered on the project ([#1264](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1264), [#1265](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1265))
* Scheduler Pro now performs the initial rendering of events quicker than before, by rendering them using raw data prior
  to performing calculations. Especially on large datasets this makes it feel much snappier. Requires loading normalized
  data to work optimally. Depending on how much non-UI manipulating your app does on the events the delayed calculations
  might affect your code, be sure to check out the upgrade guide ([#2251](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2251))
* Each product has a new "thin" JavaScript bundle. The thin bundle only contains product specific code, letting you
  combine multiple Bryntum products without downloading the shared code multiple times (previously only possible with
  custom-built bundles from sources). Find out more in the What's new guide ([#2805](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2805))
* Each theme is now available in a version that only has product specific CSS in it, called a `thin` version. These
  files are name `[product].[theme].thin.css` - `schedulerpro.stockholm.thin.css` for example. They are intended for
  using when you have multiple different bryntum products on the same page, to avoid including shared CSS multiple
  times. Read more about it in the `What's new` section in docs ([#3276](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3276))
* `Model` has a new `readOnly` field that is respected by UI level editing features to disallow editing records having
  `readOnly : true`. It does not directly affect the datalayer, meaning that you can still programmatically edit the
  records ([#665](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/665))
* New feature - Event Buffer - which allows visualizing things like travel time ([#2822](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2822))
* Manually scheduled tasks are changed to not skip non-working time for proposed start/end date values. Check the
  upgrade guide if you want to revert to the previous behaviour ([#2326](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2326))
* New `drag-unplanned-tasks` which shows how to drag tasks from an external grid, and highlighting available resource
  slots in the schedule while dragging
* Scheduler Pro's event rendering now uses absolute positioning instead of translation to position the event bars. This
  was changed to make native `position: sticky` work, the `stickyEvents` feature is now very thin and more performant
  ([#4055](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4055))
* New `ProjectModel` setters/getters for `assignments`, `dependencies`, `events`, `resourceTimeRanges`, `resources`,
  `timeRanges` ([#4043](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4043))
* New `drag-unplanned-tasks` which shows how to drag tasks from an external grid, and highlighting available resource
  slots in the schedule while dragging
* `window` references are replaced with `globalThis` which is supported in all modern browsers and across different JS
  environments ([#4071](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4071))
* You can now style `CalendarIntervals` by providing a `cls` field in their data. This makes it very easy to style non
  working time elements ([#3255](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3255))
* A new function called `downloadTestCase()` was added to Bryntum widgets, it is intended to simplify creating test
  cases for reporting issues on Bryntum's support forum. Running it collects the current value for the configs your app
  is using, inlines the current dataset and compiles that into a JavaScript app that is then downloaded. The app will
  most likely require a fair amount of manual tweaking to reproduce the issue, but we are hoping it will simplify the
  process for you. Run `schedulerPro.downloadTestCase()` on the console in a demo to try it
* Updated FontAwesome Free to version 6, which includes some new icons sponsored by Bryntum in the charts category:
  https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&c=charts-diagrams&s=solid
* When configured with a StateProvider and `stateId`, Scheduler Pro state is stored automatically as stateful properties
  change ([#1859](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1859))

For more details, see [What's new](https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/docs/guide/SchedulerPro/whats-new/5.0.0)
and [Upgrade guide](https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/docs/guide/SchedulerPro/upgrades/5.0.0) in docs

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] React wrappers now use the more modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd bundle. Hence
  application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and performance
  ([#2787](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2787))
* [BREAKING] The Engine `ResourceAllocationInfo` class `allocation` property has been changed from an `Array` to
  an`Object` with two properties `total` and `byAssignments`. The `total` property contains an array of the resource
  allocation intervals. And the `byAssignments` is a `Map` keeping individual assignment allocation intervals with
  assignments as keys and arrays of allocation intervals as values
  Please check [Upgrade guide](https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/docs/guide/SchedulerPro/upgrades/5.0.0) if
  your code uses that class
* [DEPRECATED] ResourceHistogram `getBarTip` config has been deprecated in favour of new `barTooltipTemplate` config
  Please check the upgrade guide and update your code accordingly
* `DependencyModel.active` field has been changed to persisted. To revert to the old behavior
  please override the field and set its `persist` config to `false`
* Code of drag-from-grid and similar demos have been simplified and if you have used that code in your application you
  should make sure to review and update your code accordingly
* The following previously deprecated Scheduler Pro configs, functions etc. where removed:
* Configs `hoursPerDay`, `daysPerWeek`, `daysPerWeek` from `CalendarModel` - previously moved to `ProjectModel`
* Config `TaskEdit#showDeleteButtton` - previously replaced by `editorConfig`
* Config `TaskEdit#extraItems` - previously replaced by `items`
* Config `TaskEdit#tabsConfig` - previously replaced by `items`
* Function `ProjectModel#propagate()` - previously replaced by `commitAsync()`
* Event `SchedulerPro#beforeExport` - in favor of `beforePdfExport` event
* Event `SchedulerPro#export` - in favor of `pdfExport` event

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `ResourceHistogram` now supports resource grouping. It displays the aggregated resources allocation on the group level
  ([#2608](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2608))
* Events can be grouped or manually positioned inside the row. See this demonstrated in the
  new `examples/custom-layouts` demo ([#1854](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1854))

### API CHANGES

  in time, the "window" of time encapsulated by the TimeAxis is moved ([#1114](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1114))
* The `EventResize` feature now uses the task's data to change the appearance by updating `endDate` or `startDate` live
  but in batched mode so that the changes are not propagated until the operation is finished. ([#2541](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2541))
* Dependencies can now be created by dropping on the target event without hitting the terminal circle element. The
  defaultValue of the DependencyModel `type` field will be used in this case. ([#3003](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3003))
* Dependency creation can now be finalized asynchronously, for example after showing the user a confirmation dialog
* For more details, see [What's new](https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/docs/guide/SchedulerPro/whats-new/4.2.0)

## 4.1.5 - 2021-06-09

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Scheduler Pro now has a `minHeight` of `10em` by default. This assures that the Scheduler Pro will get a size even if
  no other sizing rules are applied for the element it is rendered to. When the default `minHeight` is driving the
  height, a warning is shown on the console to let the dev know that sizing rules are missing. The warning is not shown
  if a `minHeight` is explicitly configured ([#2915](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2915))

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Percent Bar feature allows to use a custom field instead of percentDone ([#2739](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2739))
* Bumped the built-in version of FontAwesome Free to 5.15.3 and added missing imports to allow stacked icons etc
* Bumped the `@babel/preset-env` config target to `chrome: 75` for the UMD and Module bundles. This decreased bundle
  sizes and improved performance for modern browsers
* Updated Angular Wrappers to be compatible with Angular 6-7 in production mode for target `es2015`

### API CHANGES

* Scheduler Pro's locales have a new `GanttTaskEditor` entry. It defines the width of the task editor when using Gantt's
  editor with Scheduler Pro ([#2789](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2789))
* [DEPRECATED] EventDrag#dragTipTemplate was renamed to `tooltipTemplate` to better match the naming scheme of other
  features

* ResourceNonWorkingTime feature now has a `maxTimeAxisUnit` config to define at what time axis resolution to stop
  drawing non-working time. Defaults to 'hour', meaning when you zoom out to day view or greater the non-working
  elements will not be painted. The feature also supports configuring the Model class to use for the non-working time
  records, via `resourceTimeRangeModelClass`

  components. Set to `false` (default) to enhance performance. Set to `true` to limit memory consumption
* A new Scheduler feature `StickyEvents` enables the textual content of event bars
  to "stick" within the scrolling viewport until the event itself is out of view. ([#390](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/390))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `showDeleteButton` config on the TaskEdit feature was deprecated in favor of the `items` config
  ([#1526](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1526))

  webpack preset with no extra polyfilling. This change decreases size for the bundle by ~20% and offers performance
  enhancements for supported browsers
* [DEPRECATED] `schedulerpro.lite.umd.js` was deprecated in favor of `schedulerpro.umd.js` and will be removed in
  version 5.0

### BUG FIXES

* [#1681](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1681) - React applications are compiled with patched `react-scripts` presets. Check
  `examples/frameworks/npm/react/readme.md` for more information

## 4.0.1 - 2020-11-03

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed minor bugs

## 4.0.0 - 2020-10-19

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Added Bryntum Scheduler Pro with Timeline widget demo
* Added Pro example with draggable nested events ([#889](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/889))
* Scheduler Pro now extends `Panel` instead of `Container`. This allows you to easily add toolbars to it ([#1417](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1417))
* Added Bryntum Scheduler Pro example for Ext JS modern framework ([#1471](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1471))
* Added a new powerful MapboxGL JS integration demo, see examples/maps ([#1476](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1476))
* Added `schedulerpro.lite.umd.js` module that does not include `Promise` polyfill. This module is primarily intended to
  be used with Angular to prevent `zone.js` polyfills overwrite
* Added experimental support for Salesforce Locking Service ([#359](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/359)). The distributed bundle only supports modern
  browsers (no IE11 or non-chromium based Edge), since Salesforce drops support for these in January 1st 2021 too
* Added Lightning Web Component demo, see `examples/salesforce/src/lwc`

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] Dropped Support for Edge 18 and older. Our Edge <=18 fixes are still in place and active, but we will not
  be adding more fixes. Existing fixes will be removed in a later version
* [BREAKING] The `Default`, `Light` and `Dark` themes were renamed to `Classic`, `Classic-Light` and `Classic-Dark`
  This change highlights the fact that they are variations of the same theme, and that it is not the default theme
  (Stockholm is our default theme since version 2.0 of Grid)
* `TaskModel.calendar` property behavior has been changed. Now it returns the task own calendar only (so it could be
  `null` if the task has no own calendar specified). To get the effective calendar used by the task please use
  `TaskModel.effectiveCalendar` which refers to the actual calendar used by the task (either the task own calendar if
  provided or the project calendar)
* Model fields in derived classes are now merged with corresponding model fields (by name) in super classes. This allows
  serialization and other attributes to be inherited when a derived class only wants to change the `defaultValue` or
  other attribute of the field
* The `dateFormat` config for `type='date'` model fields has been simplified to `format`
* Propagation caused by data loading has been changed and now supports two alternative ways (fixed [#1346](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1346))
  The changes happened due to the propagation are applied either:
  1. silently: no store `change`/`update` events are triggered, records aren't modified after the propagation. This mode
     is used by default
  2. not silently: store `change`/`update` events are triggered, records are modified after the propagation
  Please check project `silenceInitialCommit` config for details
* Scheduler Pros "main" stores (EventStore, ResourceStore, AssignmentStore and DependencyStore) has had their event
  triggering modified to make sure data is in a calculated state when relevant events are triggered. This affects the
  timing of the `add`, `remove`, `removeAll`, `change` and `refresh` events. Please see the upgrade guide for more
  information ([#1486](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1486))

* It is with great pleasure we announce the 1.0 version of the Bryntum Scheduler Pro – our brand new product
  combining the visualisation capabilities of the Bryntum Scheduler with the scheduling engine of the Bryntum Gantt
  The result is a very powerful scheduling tool, which utilises Gantt data structures to reschedule successor
  tasks while respecting constraints, dependencies and calendars. A typical use case is a Manufacturing Execution
  System (MES) where staff have defined shifts, machines need downtime for maintenance / repair and tasks are
  recurring and inter-dependent
