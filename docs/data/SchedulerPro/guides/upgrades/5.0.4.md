# Upgrade guide for Scheduler Pro v5.0.4

## EventCopyPaste enabled by default
The `EventCopyPaste` feature was unintentionally not enabled by default in Scheduler Pro, with this release it is 
enabled. If that has some negative effect on your application you can turn it off:

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    features : {
        eventCopyPaste : false
    }
});
```
