# Upgrade guide for Scheduler Pro v5.5.0

## Restructuring features

Internal development made it necessary to define two features specifically for Scheduler Pro and one for Scheduler:

- `Grid.feature.RowReorder` -> `Scheduler.feature.RowReorder`
- `Grid.feature.CellEdit` -> `SchedulerPro.feature.CellEdit`
- `Scheduler.feature.Dependencies` -> `SchedulerPro.feature.Dependencies`

If you extended those features to add some custom logic or imported feature directly from source, you need change base
classes to the new ones and use correct import path.
