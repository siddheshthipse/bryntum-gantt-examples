# Upgrade guide for Scheduler Pro v5.6.7

## CalendarModel intervals field is switched to sub-store

The `intervals` field of `CalendarModel` was changed in v5.3.0, but the change was not listed in the upgrade guide.
Since v5.3.0 it behaves as a store when performing CRUD operations.
The change should not affect you unless you have implemented calendars persisting on your backend.

After this change the `calendars` store CrudManager `sync`-response should change to this form:

```json
"calendars" : {
    "rows" : [
        {
            "id"        : "business",
            "intervals" : {
                "rows" : [
                    {
                        "isWorking"          : true,
                        "id"                 : 2,
                        "recurrentEndDate"   : "on Mon at 09:00",
                        "recurrentStartDate" : "on Fri at 17:00"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

As you can see `intervals` field response conforms to a regular stores's format.

You can revert that field change back this way:

```js
// Override CalendarModel to change "intervals" field
class MyCalendarModel extends CalendarModel {

    static fields = [
        { name : 'intervals', subStore : false },
    ]

}

new Gantt({
    project : {
        // tell project to use the overridden model
        calendarModelClass : MyCalendarModel
        ...
    }
    ...
});
```
