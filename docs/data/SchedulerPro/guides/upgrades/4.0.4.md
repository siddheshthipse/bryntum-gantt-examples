# Upgrade guide for SchedulerPro v4.0.4

## Deprecated `showDeleteButton` on `TaskEdit` feature

The `showDeleteButton` config on the `TaskEdit` feature was deprecated in favor of the `items` config. It will be
removed in 5.0. If you use it, the following snippets shows how to update your code:

**Old code:**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    features : {
        taskEdit : {
            showDeleteButton : false
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    features : {
        taskEdit : {
            editorConfig : {
                bbar : {
                    items : {
                        deleteButton : false
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```
