# Upgrade guide for Scheduler Pro v5.0.3

## Validating backend responses by default
The `validateResponse` flag on ProjectModel has been changed to default to `true`. When enabled, it validates responses
from the backend and outputs a message on console if the format isn't valid. This is helpful during the development 
phase, but can be turned off in production:

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
   project : {
       // Turn response validation off
       validateResponse : false,
       ...
   } 
});
```

## New Vue wrapper config option `relayStoreEvents`

This option was introduced to allow relaying of store events to the Scheduler Pro instance. It defaults to `false` (no events
relayed) which changes the default behavior so if your application relies on relayed events, configure it as `true`.

Example:
```html
<bryntum-scheduler-pro
    :relayStoreEvents="true"
>
```

The config option applies to both Vue 2 and Vue 3.
