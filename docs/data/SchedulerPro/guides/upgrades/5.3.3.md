# Upgrade guide for Scheduler Pro v5.3.3

## Angular View Engine wrappers

New `@bryntum/schedulerpro-angular-view` is designed to work with Angular 11 and older versions, which use the View
Engine for rendering. If you are using one of the legacy Angular versions, please follow these steps to use the package:

Install the package using npm:

```shell
npm install @bryntum/schedulerpro-angular-view@5.3.3
```

Import the component in your Angular application:

```typescript
import { BryntumSchedulerProComponent } from '@bryntum/schedulerpro-angular-view';
```

Do not forget to remove previously used `@bryntum/schedulerPro-angular` package which requires Angular 12 or newer
version.

Please check [Angular integration guide](#SchedulerPro/guides/integration/angular/guide.md#ivy-and-view-engine-wrappers)
for additional information.
