# Importing EcmaScript modules from sources

Please note that this is not possible with the trial, sources are only included in the paid version.

## Include CSS

Include the CSS for the theme you want to use on page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path-to-scheduler-pro/schedulerpro.[theme].css" data-bryntum-theme>
```

## Import the classes you need

In your application code, import the classes you need from their source file. All source files are located under `lib/`
and they all offer a default export. Please note that if you want to support older browsers you need to transpile and
bundle your code since ES modules are only supported in modern browsers.

```javascript
import SchedulerPro from '../lib/SchedulerPro/view/SchedulerPro.js';
```

And then use them:

```javascript
const schedulerPro = new SchedulerPro({
    /* SchedulerPro configuration options */
})
```
