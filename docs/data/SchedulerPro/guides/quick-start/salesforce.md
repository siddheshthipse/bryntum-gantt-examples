# Getting Started with Bryntum Scheduler Pro as Lightning Web Component

Bryntum components support Salesforce LWC. To use it you need to follow a few steps:
1. Create new static resource from Bryntum theme, fonts and a special JS bundle
2. Create new Lightning Web Component using this static resource.

For your convenience we prepared a Lightning Application which features all supported
components and published it in a public repository:

[Bryntum Salesforce Showcase](https://github.com/bryntum/bryntum-salesforce-showcase#bryntum-salesforce-showcase)

To get started you need to check out this repository and deploy to a scratch org. Please
check our repository [Readme](https://github.com/bryntum/bryntum-salesforce-showcase#bryntum-salesforce-showcase)
for detailed installation steps.

## Online example

Bryntum Salesforce Showcase is deployed to our demo [developer org](https://bryntum-dev-ed.develop.lightning.force.com/lightning/n/BryntumSchedulerPro).
