# Crud Manager - in depth guide

## Introduction

Crud Manager is a mixin that adds data persistence functionality for a collection of [data stores](#Core/data/Store). It
solves the data consistency problem which will inevitably appear if managing multiples stores with related data
separately.

To illustrate the data consistency problem: Assume we have two stores, one of them contains references to the entities
in another. We add new records to both stores and issue a "save" command. If we would be managing every store
separately, network communication for one of them can fail and succeed for the other. This can easily lead to
inconsistent state of the data.

To solve this problem, the Crud Manager treats those stores as a single dataset, and combines changes from all stores
into a single HTTP request.

## Architecture

The core of the Crud Manager is the [AbstractCrudManagerMixin](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin) mixin. It can
be mixed into any class, providing data persistence capabilities. The consuming class should also add 2 additional
mixins, for Encoding and Transport.

### Encoding mixin

The Encoding mixin is responsible for serialization of the data package (encoding/decoding to/from string). Currently,
the only implementation of the encoding mixin is the [JsonEncoder](#Scheduler/crud/encoder/JsonEncoder).

Custom implementations of this mixin must have two methods:

- `encode` - encodes packages before they are sent to a server (from `Object` to a `string`). Supposed to be overridden
  in case data provided by the Crud Manager has to be transformed into format requested by server.
- `decode` - decodes server responses (from `string` to an `Object`). Supposed to be overridden in case data provided by
  server has to be transformed into format requested by the Crud Manager.

### Transport mixin

The Transport mixin is responsible for transferring data to the server (sending and receiving). Currently the only
implementation of the encoding mixin is the [AjaxTransport](#Scheduler/crud/transport/AjaxTransport)

Custom implementations of this mixin must implement two methods:

- `sendRequest` - sends a request to a server
- `cancelRequest` - cancels a request

### Core API

The core API of the Crud Manager consists of these methods:

- [addCrudStore](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-addCrudStore) - Adds a new [store](#Core/data/Store)
to the collection of managed stores
- [load](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-load) - Loads a new data package from the server. The data 
package can contain data for all stores managed by the Crud Manager.
- [sync](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-sync) - Persists the changes from all managed stores to the server.

Please also refer to [AbstractCrudManagerMixin](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin) docs, for a full list of
available properties.

## Response format

Each *Crud Manager* response regardless of its type (`load` or `sync`) includes the following properties:

| Property    | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `success`   | a Boolean property indicating whether the corresponding request is handled successfully (`true` indicates a successful operation, `false` means some error occurred) |
| `requestId` | the corresponding request identifier |
| `revision`  | the current *server revision stamp* (see ["Data revisions"](##data-revisions) for details) |

A response might optionally include `type` (either `load` or `sync`) which is not mandatory since response type normally
matches the request type. The property can be used when an application needs replying with load-response to sync request
or vise-versa (see ["Dynamic response type"](##dynamic-response-type) for details).

Besides the above properties each response contains stores data. The data is put into sections named by corresponding
store identifier. So each store has its own section with portion of the data related to that store only.
```
{
    "success"   : true,
    "requestId" : 12345,
    "revision"  : 190,
    "store1"    : {
        ...
    },
    ...
    "storeN" : {
        ...
    }
}
```

**Please note** that `success` attribute can be omitted if 
[skipSuccessProperty](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-skipSuccessProperty) config is set to `true`. In
which case a parsed response is considered valid even if `success` is not provided and treated as invalid when `success`
is explicitly `false`.

We'll take a closer look at request and response formats in below chapters.

## Response format validation

*Crud Manager* can validate responses and dump found response issues to the browser console like this:

```text
CrudManager sync response error(s):
- "events" store "rows" section should mention added record(s) #XXX sent in the request. It should contain the added records identifiers (both phantom and "real" ones assigned by the backend).
- "events" store "rows" section should mention updated record(s) #XXX sent in the request. It should contain the updated record identifiers.
- "events" store "removed" section should mention removed record(s) #XXX sent in the request. It should contain the removed record identifiers.
Please adjust your response to look like this:
{
    "events": {
        "removed": [
            {
                "id": XXX
            },
            ...
        ],
        "rows": [
            {
                "$PhantomId": XXX,
                "id": ...
            },
            {
                "id": XXX
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
Note: Please consider enabling "supportShortSyncResponse" option to allow less detailed sync responses (https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/api/Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-supportShortSyncResponse)
Note: To disable this validation please set the "validateResponse" config to false
```

The validation can be enabled with [validateResponse](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-validateResponse) config.
**Please note** that the config is meant to be used on development stage and disabled for production systems.

## Loading data

Data can either be loaded by calling the [load](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-load) method, or
declaratively by setting the [autoLoad](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-autoLoad) config to `true`. Load
requests are performed asynchronously. To be notified of when a load operation is completed, use the returned `Promise`,
or listen to the [load event](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#event-load).

When the data has been fetched, it is loaded to each of the stores in the same order as the stores were registered in
the Crud Manager. Please take a look at
the [addCrudStore](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-addCrudStore) method for more details on how to
register stores in a particular order.

### Adding custom data to request objects

There is [encoder.requestData](#Scheduler/crud/encoder/JsonEncoder#config-encoder) config allowing to add custom static data to request objects. For example:

```javascript
new CrudManager({
    // add static "foo" property to all requests data
    encoder : {
        requestData : {
            foo : 'Bar'
        }
    },
    /*...*/
});
```

Above snippet will result adding "foo" property to all requests data. So a load request might look like:
```
{
    "requestId": 123,
    "type": "load",
    "foo": "Bar",
    "stores": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Load request structure

In order to review the Crud Manager request/response packages let's imagine a sample dataset
that includes three stores:

1. `resources` which contains list of resources and has the following fields:
    - `id` resource identifier
    - `name` resource name
2. `events` which contains list of events and has the following fields:
    - `id` event identifier
    - `name` event name
    - `startDate` the date when the event starts
    - `endDate` the date when the event ends
3. `assignments` which contains a list event assignments (references `resources` and `events` tables) and has the
   following fields:
    - `id` assignment identifier
    - `eventId` event identifier
    - `resouceId` resource identifier
    - `assignedDT` timestamp when the assignment was created

The following example illustrates how a load request package could look for this data structure:

```json
{
    "requestId"   : 123,
    "type"        : "load",
    "stores"      : [
        {
            "id"        : "resources",
            "someParam" : "abc"
        },
        "events",
        "assignments"
    ]
}
```

In the above example:

- `requestId` property contains a unique request identifier included with every request (filled automatically by the
  Crud Manager)
- `type` property is the request type (`load` - for load requests, `sync` - for sync requests)
- `stores` section contains the list of stores to be loaded. As the bare minimum, each store can be represented with its
  identifier (as it's done for `events` and `assignments` in the example) but optionally they can be represented with an
  object to pass as a store descriptor in the JSON `data` parameter. These parameters can be provided in
  the [load](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-load) method.

```javascript
    crudManager.load({
        // specify a data object for resource store
        resources : {
            someParam : 'abc'
        }
    }).catch(() => {
        // ... handle loading failure
    });
```

### Passing HTTP Request Parameters

A special `request` option to the [load](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-load) method is passed into
the [sendRequest](#Scheduler/crud/transport/AjaxTransport#function-sendRequest) method to allow the HTTP request to be
modified. For example, to add extra HTTP request parameters, use

```javascript
crudManager.load({
    // specify options for the AjaxTransport's HTTP request
    request : {
        params : {
            startDate : '2024-02-01',
            endDate   : '2024-02-29'
        }
    }
}).catch(() => {
    // ... handle loading failure
});
```

Extra HTTP request parameters may be statically defined in the `crudManager`'s configuration:

```js
new Scheduler({
    crudManager : {
        autoLoad  : true,
        transport : {
            load : {
                url    : 'loadDataUrl',
                method : 'POST',
                params : {
                    accessLevel    : 'full',
                    userIdentifier : 'et13',
                    viewId         : 'projectAlpha'
                },
            }
        }
    }
});
```

Full docs about `transport` config may be found [here](#Scheduler/crud/transport/AjaxTransport#config-transport).

### Store identifiers

The store identifiers used in the Crud Manager server communication protocol are taken from the corresponding stores 
`id` property by default. This behavior can be changed to force the Crud Manager to retrieve the identifiers from 
another property (see [storeIdProperty](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-storeIdProperty) for details).

### Load response structure

Then response for the load request described in "Load request structure" chapter could look like this:

```json
{
    "success"     : true,
    "requestId"   : 123,
    "revision"    : 5,

    "events"       : {
        "rows" : [
            { "id" : 65, "name" : "Meeting", "startDate" : "2024-02-05T10:00:00.000Z", "endDate" : "2024-02-05T11:30:00.000Z" },
            { "id" : 9000, "name" : "Lunch", "startDate" : "2024-02-05T11:30:00.000Z", "endDate" : "2024-02-05T12:30:00.000Z" },
            { "id" : 9001, "name" : "Conference", "startDate" : "2024-02-05T13:00:00.000Z", "endDate" : "2024-02-05T17:00:00.000Z" }
        ],
        "total" : 5
    },

    "resources"      : {
        "rows" : [
            { "id" : 1, "name" : "Leo" },
            { "id" : 2, "name" : "James Fenimore" },
            { "id" : 3, "name" :  "Kate" }
        ],
        "total" : 3
    },

    "assignments"      : {
        "rows" : [
            { "id" : 1, "eventId" : 65, "resourceId" : 2, "assignedDT" : "2024-02-06T07:47:33.345Z" },
            { "id" : 2, "eventId" : 65, "resourceId" : 3, "assignedDT" : "2024-02-06T07:47:38.123Z" },
            { "id" : 3, "eventId" : 9000, "resourceId" : 1, "assignedDT" : "2024-02-06T09:37:33.445Z" },
            { "id" : 4, "eventId" : 9000, "resourceId" : 3, "assignedDT" : "2024-02-06T09:37:59.999Z" },
            { "id" : 5, "eventId" : 9001, "resourceId" : 1, "assignedDT" : "2024-02-06T15:17:33.001Z" },
            { "id" : 6, "eventId" : 9001, "resourceId" : 2, "assignedDT" : "2024-02-06T15:17:34.002Z" }
        ],
        "total" : 6
    }
}
```

In the above example the store data is grouped by store identifier. Each store data section has:

- `rows` - An array of store records
- `total` - The total number of records

## Saving data

The *Crud Manager* saves data by sending a *sync* request. A sync request includes data changes of all registered
stores. When collecting a store changes the *Crud Manager* includes persistable fields data only (regulated by field
["persist"](#Core/data/field/DataField#config-persist) config). Alternatively the *Crud Manager* can send all fields
if [writeAllFields](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-writeAllFields) option is enabled.

### Adding custom data to request objects

There is [encoder.requestData](#Scheduler/crud/encoder/JsonEncoder#config-encoder) config allowing to add custom static data to request objects. For example:

```javascript
new CrudManager({
    // add static "foo" property to all requests data
    encoder : {
        requestData : {
            foo : 'Bar'
        }
    },
    /*...*/
});
```

Above snippet will result adding "foo" property to all requests data. So a sync request might look like:
```
{
    "requestId": 123,
    "type": "sync",
    "revision": 5,
    "foo": "Bar",
    ...
}
```

The request is triggered either manually by calling [sync](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-sync)
method or can be invoked automatically after any data change if the 
[autoSync](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-autoSync) config is set to `true`. A sync request is 
performed asynchronously. To be notified upon its completion, use the returned `Promise`, or listen to the 
[sync event](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#event-sync).

After the request is completed, the *Crud Manager* applies the server responded changes (if any) to each individual
store.

**Note: It's highly recommended to prevent users from changing data in the stores while a sync operation is ongoing. The
Crud Manager tries to queue additional sync requests if a user triggers a sync before a prior request is done. But
still, data changes done in parallel with ongoing sync requests may easily lead to the inconsistent state of your data,
so the recommendation is to use GUI masking technique to prevent such scenarios.**

### Sync request structure

Now in order to review the data persisting request package, let's imagine that user has made the following changes in
the stores we described above:

1. user updates the name and endDate of event named "Meeting"
2. user assigned the resource named "Kate" to the event named "Conference"
3. user deletes the event named "Lunch" completely (will also remove assignments connected to that event)

Here is how a *sync request* object could look for such changes:

```json
{
    "requestId" : 124,
    "type"      : "sync",
    "revision"  : 5,

    "events"     : {
        "updated" : [
            { "id" : 65, "name" : "Meeting - Conference planning", "endDate" : "2024-02-05T12:30:00.000Z" }
        ],
        "removed" : [
            { "id" : 9000 }
        ]
    },

    "assignments"      : {
        "added"   : [
          { "$PhantomId" : "assignment-321", "resourceId" :  3, "eventId" :  9001 }
        ],
        "removed" : [
            { "id" : 3 },
            { "id" : 4 }
        ]
    }
}
```

In the above example:

- `requestId` property is the unique request identifier
- `type` property is the request type `sync` or `load` (`sync` in this case since we are persisting data)
- `revision` property is the current *server revision stamp* the client has

For each store, the request has three sections `added`, `updated` and `removed` under which the corresponding records
are placed. The presence of each section is optional depending on the presence of such type of modifications.

Each added record is sent including its *phantom identifier* (auto-generated client side unique value used to identify
the record) ([by default](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-phantomIdField) the `$PhantomId`, field name
is used). This is illustrated by the assignment of the resource named "Kate" to the event named "Conference". 

**Note: Please do not persist phantom record identifiers as-is on the server. That might cause collisions on the client
after data reloading. It's expected that backend assigns new identifiers to added records.**

Each updated record data includes its identifier plus the updated field values. This is illustrated by the updated name
and endDate in the event named "Meeting".

And finally for removed records, only their identifiers are transferred (demonstrated by removed event which also 
removed the linked assignments).

Please note that by default, only changed fields and any fields configured
with [alwaysWrite](#Core/data/field/DataField#config-alwaysWrite)
are sent. If you want all fields to always be sent, please
see [writeAllFields](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-writeAllFields).

### Sync response structure

The Response to the sync request basically has two objectives:

1. to confirm that certain changes were applied
2. to update the client with any changes that were made by the server

*Crud Manager* supports two response formats *short* and *full* sync responses. The short format is enabled by default.
Toggling the formats can be done by setting
[supportShortSyncResponse](#Scheduler/data/CrudManager#config-supportShortSyncResponse) config.

#### Short sync response

This type of response does not require all sent records to be listed in the corresponding response. The response should
include **only** changes made on the server-side. So in case there is no server-side changes involved a response might
look like this:

```json
{
    "success"   : true,
    "requestId" : 576,
    "revision"  : 61
}
```

Which can reduced even more when [skipSuccessProperty](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-skipSuccessProperty) config is `true`:

```json
{
    "requestId" : 576,
    "revision"  : 61
}
```

And `revision` attribute can be also skipped if the backend does not perform revisions validation:

```json
{
    "requestId" : 576
}
```

Whenever the server makes changes to the synced data, the new values must be part of the response. For example when
saving an added record the server provides new identifier value for the record and it has to be responded.

As reaction to the request described in the previous chapter we could have the following response:

```json
{
    "success"     : true,
    "requestId"   : 124,
    "revision"    : 6,

    "assignments" : {
        "rows" : [
            { "$PhantomId" : "assignment-321", "id" : 17, "assignedDT" : "2024-02-15T08:47:33.345Z" }
        ],
        "removed" : [
            { "id" : 12 },
            { "id" : 13 }
        ]
    },
  
    "events" : {
      "removed" : [
        { "id" : 10001 }
      ]
    }
}
```

For each store there are two sections `rows` and `removed`.

The `rows` section list data changes made *by the server*. As the bare minimum, for each added record sent from the
client, the server should return the record *phantom identifier* and its "real" identifier assigned by the database. If
the server decides to update *any* other fields of *any* record it should return an object holding a combination of the
record identifier and new field values (this is shown in above snippet where server sets `assignedDT` field value
`2024-02-15T08:47:33.345Z` for the assignment of the resource named "Kate" to the event named "Conference"). The field
values will be applied to the corresponding store record on the client. **Note** that this way the server can also 
provide new records to the client by passing them in the `rows` section.

The `removed` section contains identifiers of records removed *by the server*. The short response type does not require
records initially removed on the client to be repeated in response `removed` section. In this mode `removed` should hold
only removals initiated by the server (due to some server logic or coming from other concurrent session etc). The
response in the snippet above includes removal of `event` store record with id `10001`, and the connected assignments 
with id's `12` and `13`, initiated by the server.

#### Full response

This type of response requires all records sent in sync request to be listed in the corresponding response. This verbose
response format is kept for backward compatibility reasons. As reaction to the request described in the previous chapter
we could have the following response:

```json
{
    "success"     : true,
    "requestId"   : 124,
    "revision"    : 6,

    "events" : {
        "rows" : [
            { "id" : 65 }
        ],
        "removed" : [
            { "id" : 9000 }
        ]
    },

    "assignments" : {
        "rows" : [
            { "$PhantomId" : "assignment-321", "id" : 17,  "assignedDT" : "2024-02-15T08:47:33.345Z" }
        ],
        "removed" : [
            { "id" : 3 },
            { "id" : 4 }
        ]
    }
}
```

For each store there are two sections `rows` and `removed`, where:

- `rows` holds all records added or updated *by the server*. As the bare minimum, for added records sent from the
  client, the server returns a combination of record *phantom identifier* and its "real" identifier assigned by the
  database. If the server decides to update *any* other fields of *any* record it should return an object holding a
  combination of the record identifier and new field values. The field values will be applied to the corresponding store
  record on the client. **Note** that this way the server can also provide new records to the client by passing them in
  the `rows` section.
- `removed` holds ids of records removed *by the server* whether initially sent from client or removed due to some
  server logic.

You can get the current changes in the CrudManager anytime using
the [changes](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#property-changes)
property.

## Dynamic response type

A server can potentially implement complex logic and decide which type of response works better for a client request. So
for example it might reply with *load* response on a *sync* request when the client data is very outdated or under some
other circumstances. Or it might reply with *sync* on a *load* attempt responding with delta changes instead of all the
records. To enable this mode Crud
Manager [trackResponseType](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#config-trackResponseType) should be set to `true`:

```javascript
const crudManager = new CrudManager({
    trackResponseType : true,
    /* ... */
})
```

and response should include `type` property:
```
{
    "type": "load",
    "success": true,
    ...
}
```
or
```
{
    "type": "sync",
    "success": true,
    ...
}
```

## Data revisions

The server interaction protocol supports a *server revision stamp* (a number incremented after every data update on the
server). Based on this value, the server may reject a save request, containing possibly outdated data. This can be
useful in case of a system with lots of concurrent data write operations, offering you additional control of the data
integrity and consistency.

This capability is optional and can be easily turned on or off in the server-side code depending on your requirements.

## Error handling

In case of an error happening while loading or persisting, the response object will look like this:

```json
{
    "success"   : false,
    "requestId" : 123890,
    "message"   : "Error description goes here",
    "code"      : 13
}
```

In the above example:

- `success` is `false` indicating that an error has occurred. Not staged changes will be a part of next sync request.
- `requestId` has the failed request identifier
- `message` contains the error message
- `code` has an optional error code

Both [load](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-load)
and [sync](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-sync) methods return `Promise`s so error handling looks
like this:

```javascript
const crudManager = new CrudManager({
    /*...*/
    transport       : {
        load : {
            url : 'php/read.php'
        },
        sync : {
            url : 'php/save.php'
        }
    }
});

crudManager.load().
    // loading failed
    catch(response => {
        // show notification with error message
        Toast.show(response && response.message || 'Unknown error occurred');
    }).
    // no load errors occurred
    then(() => {
        /*...*/
    });
```

Alternatively you can listen to the [loadFail](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#event-loadFail)
and [syncFail](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#event-syncFail) events:

```javascript
let crudManager;

// A function to handle CRUD errors
function processError(event) {
    // error code
    const response = event.response,
            code = response && response.code;

    // here we can define some specific reactions on certain errors
    if (code === 13) {
        // for example re-load crudManager
        crudManager.load();

    // and for all other cases we just display the error message
    } else {
        // show notification with error message
        Toast.show(response && response.message || 'Unknown error occurred');
    }
};

crudManager = new CrudManager({
    autoLoad        : true,
    /*...*/
    transport       : {
        load : {
            url : 'php/read.php'
        },
        sync : {
            url : 'php/save.php'
        }
    },
    listeners       : {
        // listen to load request errors
        loadFail : processError,
        // listen to sync request errors
        syncFail : processError
    }
});
```
