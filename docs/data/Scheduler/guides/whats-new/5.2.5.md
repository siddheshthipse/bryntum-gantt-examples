# What's new in Scheduler v5.2.5

## Enlarged clickable area for dependency lines

The `Dependencies` feature has a new `clickWidth` config, that lets you enlarge the clickable area for dependency lines. 
By specifying a value > 1, a second invisible line will be drawn along the same path but with a wider stroke. This makes
the line appear thin, but it will be easier to reach with the mouse. Since two lines are drawn instead of one, the 
tradeoff is slightly reduced drawing performance. 

The `dependencies` demo has been updated with a slider for adjusting it.
