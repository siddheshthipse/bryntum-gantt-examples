# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v5.2.7

## The `event` property of the EventDrag feature's events `beforeEventDrag` and `eventDragStart` is being renamed

The EventDrag feature triggers `beforeEventDrag` and `eventDragStart` when dragging events in the Scheduler. In the
event data object the property previously named `event` is replaced by `domEvent`.

Simply use the new property name instead:

**Old code:**
```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    listeners : {
        beforeEventDrag ({ eventRecord, event }){
            return event.ctrlKey
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**
```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    listeners : {
        beforeEventDrag ({ eventRecord, domEvent }){
            return domEvent.ctrlKey
        }
    }
});
```

## Configurable handle sizes for the EventResize feature deprecated

The size of handle zones for resizing events is determined from CSS now. No code changes are necessary.
