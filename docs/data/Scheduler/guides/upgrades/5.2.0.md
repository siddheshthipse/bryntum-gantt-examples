# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v5.2.0

## The highlightWeekends config of the NonWorkingTime feature was deprecated

It is superfluous, disabling the feature will yield the same result. It has been deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.

**Old code:**
```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        nonWorkingTime : {
            highlightWeekends : false
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**
```javascript
// To be able to toggle it at runtime:

const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        nonWorkingTime : {
            disabled : true
        }
    }
});

// Or if you don't want to use the feature at all:

const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        nonWorkingTime : false
    }
});
```
