# Scheduler features

Features are classes that add functionality to Scheduler. The purpose of this guide is to give an overview of the
features that ships with Scheduler and show how you can configure them.

## Enabling/disabling and configuring features

Features are configured using Schedulers [`features`](#Grid/view/Grid#config-features)-config. Some features are enabled
by default, in which case you can disable them like this:

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        columnLines : false,
        eventResize : false
    }
});
```

Others require you to enable them:

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        labels     : true,
        timeRanges : true
    }
});
```

Some features have configuration options (see the API docs for each feature for the options). In such cases you can
specify an configuration object instead of `true`:

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        eventDrag : { // Configuration object
            constrainDragToResource : true
        },
        sort      : 'name' // Configuration shortcut using string, only availble for certain features
    }
});
```

If you need to access a feature at runtime, they are available through the `features` property on Scheduler:

```javascript
scheduler.features.eventEdit.showRecord(someEventRecord);
```

If you want to create a custom feature, head over to [GridFeatureManager](#Grid/feature/GridFeatureManager) docs.


<div class="note">

If a feature is set to <code>false</code>, it is not included at all and will be <code>undefined</code>. 
You can see it by <code>console.log(scheduler.features.timeRanges)</code> when
<code>timeRanges</code> is set to <code>false</code>.

</div>

## Features in the box

Scheduler itself has built-in core functionality for rendering resources & events, selection and keyboard navigation. On
top of that it ships with the features described below, some of which are enabled by default and some which you have to
enable manually.

## Importing features from sources

A feature is registered when the application imports it. When using the regular module/umd bundle, this is done
automatically, as the bundle encapsulates all code inside. However, when utilizing sources or thin bundles, a feature
might not be imported by default. For any feature not enabled by default, it is essential to ensure that you have
imported it to be able to use it.

Example:

```javascript
import Scheduler from 'PATH_TO_SOURCE/Scheduler/view/Scheduler.js';
import 'PATH_TO_SOURCE/Scheduler/feature/Dependencies.js';

const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        dependencies : {
            // Feature condig
        }
    }
});
```
